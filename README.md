# Kickstarting with Excel   

## Overview of Project
To vizulaize how different campaign outcomes fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to show the trends that contributed for success/Failure of crowdfunding for different countries. Here in this deliverable we filtering it to get data for theatre projects based on their launch dates and also relationship between success/Failure of crowdfunding and goals set for the projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
The assignement involves two technical analysis deliverables:
1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
2. Outcomes Based on Goals Chart

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This involved creating a pivot table based on "Parent Category" & Years (which we extracted from the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date) as filters and Outcomes of the campagins in the columns and as well as in Values and Date Created Conversion in the rows , but here we only need Months and we have to remove years and quarters.We have to sort them in the chronological order of months. Also, to display Outcomes in the desired format we need to sort them in ascending order.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals -
The purpose of this deliverable to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the different range of funding goal amounts and also for a specific Subcategory of "plays". The goal ranges varies from less than 1000 to greater than 50000 and all respective ranges in 5000 increments. Percentage of each of the outcomes(Successful/Failed/Failed) is calculated for each of these ranges. To create a line chart to visualize Goal amounts for different ranges on X-axis Vs %goal amounts on the Y-axis. The chart shows there are no canceled projects for "plays"

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Following can be observed in the line chart - 
1. Out of 1369 total campaings in "May" Successful outcome was at peak with a value of 111 and the least value in December at 37. Best time to launch a new project is between April - September.
January , March , September & November had similar values of failed campaigns & with May , Jun , July , Aug & November with similar failed peaks. 
2. Canceled outcomes were through out the year very close x axis , showing they have minimum values showing they remained
steady throught out year which shows that cancelation doesn't depend when they are launched. 
Except for October with zero canceled projects. The pivot chart shows monthly outcomes for the projects & also the grand-total for the entire year.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The campaigns with goals of less than 5000 were most successful. 
2. The campaigns between 10000-25000 had similar values of success & failures. 
3. The campaigns above 25000 are like to face failure except between ranges 35000-40000 but there aren't much campaings & projects to confirm about the trend (about )

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The analysis is based on the outcome over the range of years , the data show is not specific for a particular year it could be average data across year. The data could be for different countries too, this could vary if we take individual country/year in consideration.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Analysis could be made based on goals set for different countries 
2. Line charts for different categories during the year so that we can compare their perfomance at different times during year.
3. Comparison stacked bars of diffrent categories/subcategories for different countries.
